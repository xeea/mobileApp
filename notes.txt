decided to use phonegap-build for an IOS devie 
it has a learning curve.
should use zeptojs.com instead of jquerry since we sont need to run the app on different browsers its smaller than jquerry.

-create files and test run normally index.html js and css
-upload to github
-need apple developers account for key to build for IOS
-when done you can either download the mobile version on your computer and transfer it to your phone or take a screen-shot of the code and install/download with the Goggles QR code
