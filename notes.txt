decided to use phonegap-build for an IOS devie 
it has a learning curve.
should use zeptojs.com instead of jquerry since we sont need to run the app on different browsers its smaller than jquerry.

-create files and test run normally index.html js and css
-upload to github
-need apple developers account for key to build for IOS
-when done you can either download the mobile version on your computer and transfer it to your phone or take a screen-shot of the code and install/download with the Goggles QR code

problem creatign provisioning file and threviously createed provisionning profile is expired``

ok so now i have realized that we have to use ionic to give our app a native  lokk and feel and use phonegap build to deploy versions on the mobile paltforms.

to use ionic i can use similar code from he previous files and some from the desktop version to make the 3 view pages: goal for today!!
